<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Fruit Beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Fruit Beers may range widely from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Malt sweetness can vary from none to medium-high levels. Hop bitterness is in balance and usually at very low to medium levels. Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters moreso than the addition of fruit itself. As an example, a juniper berry-flavored beer with notable juniper berry fruity flavor and/or aroma characters evident would be appropriately considered as Fruit Beer; whereas such a beer in which juniper berry characters are expressed more as herbal or spice quality would appropriately be considered as an Herb and Spice Beer. For purposes of this competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as field beer.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Fruit Wheat Beers are straw to light amber, with hue depending on type of fruit used. Color should reflect a degree of fruit&rsquo;s color. Chill haze is acceptable. When served with yeast, appearance is hazy to very cloudy. Fruit or fruit extracts contribute aroma with fruit qualities perceived as authentic and replicating true fruit complexity as much as possible. Low fruity-ester aroma is typical, as is low to medium-low malt aroma. Fruited German-style wheat beers that fi t the other descriptors for this style are permissible. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. Yeast and yeast generated aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering in versions served with yeast. Hop aroma is low to medium. Low to medium-low malt sweetness is present. Hop flavor is low to medium. Hop bitterness is low to medium. These beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast. Grist includes at least 30 percent malted wheat. Fruit or fruit extracts contribute flavor with fruit qualities perceived as authentic and replicating true fruit complexity as much as possible. Low fruity-ester flavor from yeast is typical. Diacetyl flavor should not be perceived. Yeast and yeast generated flavor should be low to medium but not overpowering in versions served with yeast. Body is low to medium. In versions served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Field Beers are any beers using vegetables as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities. Field Beers may range widely from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Vegetable aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Malt sweetness can vary from very low to medium-high levels. Hop bitterness is very low to medium-high. Vegetable qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of vegetable characters more so than the addition of vegetable itself. As an example, a chili-flavored beer with notable roast or vegetal chili flavor and/or aroma characters evident would be appropriately considered as Field Beer; whereas such a beer in which chili characters are expressed more as herbal or spice quality (such as the &ldquo;heat&rdquo; of a chili pepper) would appropriately be considered as Herb/Spice Beers. For purposes of this competition, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut would be appropriately entered as fi eld beer.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Pumpkin Beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) or winter squash as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities. Pumpkin Beers may range widely from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Pumpkin or winter squash aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident. These beers may or may not be spiced with other ingredients. Hop and spice aromas should not overpower pumpkin or squash aromas. Hop aroma is low to medium. Malt sweetness often varies from low to medium high levels. Hop flavor is low to medium, and not overpowering pumpkin or squash characters. Hop bitterness is low to medium-low. Exemplary versions exhibit pumpkin or squash characters, which should not be overpowered by balanced, harmonious hop or spice characters (if present).</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Herb/Spice Beers are any beers using herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character. Herb and Spice Beers may range from light brown to black depending on underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Individual aroma and/or flavor characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable. Malt sweetness will vary dramatically depending on overall balance desired. Hop bitterness is very low to low hop bitterness is optimal for highlighting herbal/spice characters. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Classifying these beers can be complex; entries which exhibit primarily herbal and/or spicy qualities would appropriately considered as Herb/Spice Beer. As described in other categories and by way of example, chili-flavored beer with notable roast or vegetal chili flavor and/or aroma characters evident would be appropriately considered as Field Beer; whereas such a beer in which chili characters are expressed more as herbal or spice quality (such as the &ldquo;heat&rdquo; of a chili pepper) would appropriately be considered as Herb/Spice Beers. Pumpkin beers in which herb and spice characters dominate would also be appropriately be considered as Herb/Spice beers.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Chocolate Beers are any beers using &ldquo;dark&rdquo; chocolate or cocoa in any of its forms other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character. Chocolate Beers may range from is light brown to black depending on underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Medium-low to medium-high malt sweetness helps accent cocoa flavors and aromas. Hop flavor is lower than might be expected for style of beer. Under hopping allows chocolate to contribute to the flavor profile while not becoming excessively bitter. Hop bitterness is very low to medium-low. Other flavors may be infused but chocolate should be dominant character. For purposes of this competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as field beer.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Coffee Beers are any beers using coffee in any of its forms to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character. Coffee beers may range from amber to black depending on underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Medium low to medium malt sweetness helps accent coffee flavor and aromas. Hop flavor is lower than might be expected for style of beer. Under hopping allows coffee to contribute to the flavor profile while not becoming excessively bitter. Hop bitterness is very low to medium.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Specialty Beers are any beers brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley. Specialty Beers may range from very light to black depending on underlying style. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Malt sweetness will vary dramatically depending on overall balance desired. Hop bitterness is very low to very high, and may be used for highlighting desired characters. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident in the aroma, flavor and/or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus a beer brewed with nuts would be appropriately considered as a Specialty Beer. A beer brewed with honey would most appropriately be considered as a Honey Beer. Beer brewed with roots, seeds, flowers etc. and which exhibit herbal and/or spicy characters would be appropriately considered as Herb and Spice Beer. Examples might include a chili-flavored beer that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor, or a juniper berry beer in which juniper berry characters are expressed more as herbal or spice quality than as berry fruity character. While beers brewed with fruits or vegetables may derive fermentable carbohydrate from those sources, such beers which exhibit fruit or vegetable qualities would most appropriately be considered as fruit or field beers. For purposes of this competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as field beer.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Rye Beers are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. As such they include a wide range of color. Lighter versions are straw to copper, while darker versions are dark amber to dark brown. Chill haze is acceptable in these versions packaged and served without yeast. In versions served with yeast, appearance may range from hazy to very cloudy. Low spicy, fruity-estery aromas are typical. Phenolic, clove-like aromas should not be perceived. In darker versions malt aromas can optionally include low roasted malt characters evident as cocoa/chocolate or caramel, and/ or aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. No yeast aroma should be evident in versions without yeast. Low to medium yeast aroma should not overpower the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops in versions with yeast. Hop aroma is low to medium-high. In darker versions malt flavor can optionally include low roasted malt characters evident as cocoa/chocolate or caramel, and/or aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters. Low level roast malt astringency acceptable when balanced with low to medium level malt sweetness. Hop flavor is low to medium-high. Hop bitterness is low to medium. These beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast. Grist should include at least 20 percent rye malt. Low level spicy, fruity-ester flavor is typical; phenolic clove-like characteristics and diacetyl should not be perceived. Low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. Body is low to medium. In versions packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel. Versions served with yeast should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Session Beers are the color of the classic beer style being made to lower strength. Appearance will vary with style of beer being made to lower strength. Aroma depends on the style of beer being made to lower strength. Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style guidelines. The goal should be to reach a balance between the style&rsquo;s character and the lower alcohol content. Drinkability is a character in the overall balance of these beers. Beers in this category must not exceed 4.1% alcohol by weight (5.1% alcohol by volume).</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Ice Lagers are very pale to golden. Chill haze is absent. Fruity-ester and diacetyl aromas should not be perceived. Hop aroma is low. Low residual malt sweetness is present. Hop flavor is low. Hop bitterness is low but certainly perceptible. This style is slightly higher in alcohol than most other light-colored, American-style lagers. It has few or no adjuncts. Typically these beers are chilled before filtration so that ice crystals (which may or may not be removed) are formed. This can contribute to a higher alcohol content (up to 0.5% more). Fruity-ester and diacetyl flavors should not be perceived. Body is low to medium.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Malt Liquors are straw to gold. Chill haze is absent. Fruity-ester and complex alcohol aromas (though not solvent-like) are acceptable at low levels. Diacetyl aroma should not be perceived. Hop aroma is virtually none. Some residual sweetness is perceived. Hop flavor is virtually none. Hop bitterness is very low. High in starting gravity and alcoholic strength, this style is somewhat diverse. Some malt liquors are just slightly stronger than American lagers, while others approach bock strength. Fruity-ester and complex alcohol (though not solvent-like) flavors are acceptable at low levels. Diacetyl flavor should not be perceived. Body is low to medium-low.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Experimental Beers are any range of color. Experimental beer is any beer that is primarily grain-based and employs unusual techniques and/or ingredients. A minimum 51% of the fermentable carbohydrates must be derived from malted grains. The overall uniqueness of the process, ingredients used and creativity should be considered in positive evaluations. Beers such as field, fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty or other beers that match existing categories should not be entered into this category. Beers not easily matched to existing style categories in a competition would often be entered into this category. Beers that are a combination of two or more other categories, and which exhibit distinctive characters of each of those categories, may also be entered into this category.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Fresh Hop Ales are the color of the underlying ale style being made with fresh hops. Fruity-ester aroma is high, although somewhat dependent on the ale style being made with fresh hops. Hop aroma is prominent and will exhibit especially aromas of green, almost chlorophyll-like or other fresh hop characters. Malt perception will vary with the style of ale being made with fresh hops. Hop flavor is prominent, exhibiting especially flavors of green, almost chlorophyll-like or other fresh hop characters. Hop bitterness is dependent on the style of ale being made with fresh hops. These ales are hopped predominantly with fresh (newly harvested and kilned) and/or undried (&ldquo;wet&rdquo;) hops. Beers may be aged and enjoyed after initial &ldquo;fresh-hop&rdquo; character diminishes. Unique character from &ldquo;aged&rdquo; fresh hop beers may emerge, but have yet to be defined. Body is dependent on the style of ale being made with fresh hops.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Indigenous Beers are very light to black. Malt sweetness will vary dramatically depending on overall balance desired. Hop bitterness is very low to very high, and may be used for highlighting desired characters. This beer style is unusual in that its impetus is to commemorate combinations of ingredients and/or techniques adopted by or unique to a particular region. At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world. There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. This style is indigenous beers that are not represented elsewhere as a definitive style in these guidelines. Indigenous beers could possibly be entered in such categories as Experimental, Herb &amp; Spice, Field Beer, etc. but by choice a brewer may categorize (and enter) an indigenous beer in this category. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.) It may represent a historical tradition or it may be an innovative creation representing contemporary ingredients or process. This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, unusual ingredients, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level, or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style Sahti, S American Chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Gluten-Free Beers are very light to black. These are beers (lager, ale or other) made from fermentable sugars, grains and converted carbohydrates. Ingredients do not contain gluten, in other words zero gluten (No barley, wheat, spelt, rye, etc.) Gluten-Free Beers may, or may not, contain malted grains that do not contain gluten. Sweetness will vary dramatically depending on overall balance desired. Hop bitterness is very low to very high, and may be used for highlighting desired characters. Brewers may, or may not, design and identify these beers along other style guidelines with regard to aroma, flavor and appearance profile. The beer&rsquo;s overall balance and character should be based on its own merits and not necessarily compared with traditional styles of beer. In competitions, brewers identify ingredients and fermentation type. NOTE: These guidelines do not supersede any government regulations. Wine, mead, flavored malt beverages or beverages other than &ldquo;beer&rdquo; as defined by the TTB (U.S. Trade and Tax Bureau) are not considered &ldquo;gluten-free beer&rdquo; under these guidelines.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Pale American-Belgo Ales are gold to light brown. Chill haze may be evident. Fruity-ester aroma is medium to high. Hop aroma is medium to very high, exhibiting American type hop aromas not usually found in traditional Belgian styles. Hop flavor is medium to very high. Hop bitterness is medium to very high. Fruity-ester flavor should be medium to high. Yeast derived characters such as banana, berry, apple, sometimes coriander spice-like and/or smoky-phenolic characters should be portrayed with balance of hops and malt character when fermented with Belgian yeasts. Diacetyl should be absent. Sulfur-like yeast character should be absent. Brettanomyces character should be absent. Brettanomyces character should be absent; mixed tradition ales exhibiting Brettanomyces character would more appropriately be classified as American-style Brett Ale. Pale American-Belgo-Style Ales are either 1) non-Belgian beer types portraying the unique characters imparted by yeasts typically used in big fruity Belgian-style ales, or 2) defined Belgian-style beers portraying a unique character of American hops. These beers are unique beers unto themselves.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>American Sour Ales are very light to black, and may take on color of other ingredients. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Moderate to intense yet balanced fruity-ester aromas are evident. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like aromas are subtly present. Diacetyl and DMS aromas should not be perceived. Hop aroma is evident over a full range from low to high. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like flavors are subtly present. Hop bitterness is evident over a full range from low to high. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. The acidity present is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. Moderate to intense yet balanced fruity-ester flavors are evident. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. Diacetyl and DMS flavors should not be perceived. Body is evident over a full range from low to high.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Wood-Aged Pale to Ambers are pale to copper. For purposes of competition these wood-aged beers have color less than 18 SRM or 36 EBC, and contain alcohol less than 5.2% abw or 6.5% abv. Darker wood-aged beers (&gt;18 SRM or &gt;36 EBC) or higher alcohol wood-aged beers (&gt;5% abw or &gt;6.25% abv) of any color would be more appropriately considered as other beer styles. Any lager, ale or hybrid beer in the appropriate color range, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer, can be aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. Primary character of the original beer style may or may not be apparent. These beers are aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel; but, wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Wood-Aged Pale to Amber Beers may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Fruited or spiced beer that is wood and barrel aged would also be appropriately entered in this category. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Wood-Aged Strong Stouts are characteristically dark to very dark. Any of the traditional stronger stout styles or unique experimental stouts, can be aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. For purposes of competition entries in this category should contain &gt;5.2% abw (&gt;6.5% abv). Primary character of the original stout beer style may or may not be apparent. These beers are aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel; but, wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Wood-Aged Beers may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Examples of wood- and barrel-aged strong stout styles include but are not limited to stronger versions of wood- and barrel-aged foreign stout, British- or American-style Imperial stout, other strong stout styles, or other strong beer styles blended with stout that meet the criteria for alcohol content. Sour higher alcohol wood-aged strong stouts (&gt;5.2% abw or 6.5% abv) should be entered in another category.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Wood-Aged Sours are very light to black. Any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer, can be aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood, and, develop bacterial induced natural acidity. These beers are aged with the intention of introducing the micro fl ora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel; but, wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of wood-derived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Usually bacteria and &ldquo;wild&rdquo; yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Wood-Aged Beers may or may not have Brettanomyces character.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Fruited Wood-Aged Sours are very light to black, possibly taking on the hue of added fruit. Any fruited lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer, can be aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood, and, develop bacterial induced natural acidity. These beers are aged with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel; but, wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of wood-derived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Entries in this subcategory have fruit added at different stages up to and including during wood aging. Usually bacteria and &ldquo;wild&rdquo; yeast fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. These wood-aged beers may or may not have Brettanomyces
character.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Aged Beers are any range or color from very light to black. Aged Beers are any beer aged for over one year. A brewer may brew any type of beer of any strength and enhance its character with extended and creative aging conditions. Generally, but not exclusively, beers with high hopping rates, roast malt content, high alcohol content, and/or complex herbal, smoke or fruit content lend themselves to aging. Beers which are wood aged, or exhibit Brettanomyces characters or sour/acidic beers should be classified or entered into other categories if those options are available. Beers in this category may be aged in bottles or any type of food grade vessel. Aged character may manifest itself in mouthfeel, aroma and flavor. Often aged character is an expression of oxidative reactions that either bring individual extreme characters into harmony or are characters unique unto themselves. Sherry, fruity and hop transitions are common during aging. No matter what the effect, the overall balance should be balanced, harmonic and not extreme or distastefully aggressive. The level of changes created by aging will vary with different types of beer types. Lighter flavored beer types may often manifest aggressive and distasteful oxidation. Whereas higher elevations of hops, malt or alcohol can help create synergies with &ldquo;good&rdquo; oxidative change.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Unfiltered German Lagers are the color of the underlying German lager style. Appearance may or may not be clear, so may appear slightly hazy to moderately cloudy. Exhibiting a small amount of yeast haze is acceptable. These beers are unfiltered, but may be naturally clear due to settling of yeast during aging. Head retention may not be optimal. Kellerbier Lagers are unfiltered lagered versions of Germanic lager beer styles such as Mu&#776;nchner Helles and Dunkel, Dortmunder/ Export, Bohemian Pilsener and German Pilsener. Aromas typical of the underlying beer style are present. Low to medium levels of yeast-generated sulfur aromas should be apparent in aroma. Low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally scrubbed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. Subtle or low fruity-ester aromas may be apparent. Diacetyl aroma should be absent. Hop aroma is variable with style, with dry hopped characters acceptable. Malt character will vary with style (see individual style descriptions). Hop flavor is variable with style, with dry hopped characters acceptable. Hop bitterness is variable with style. Kellerbier Lagers have low to medium carbonation. Subtle or low fruity-esters flavors may be apparent. Low to medium levels of yeast-generated sulfur flavors should be apparent, and low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally scrubbed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. Diacetyl should be absent. Body is variable with style. The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. These unfiltered German lager styles are packaged and/or served intentionally with low to moderate amounts of yeast. Products may be filtered and again dosed with yeast in the package, manifesting themselves as bottle conditioned beers or unfiltered beer with yeast present. During registration brewers may specify pouring instructions, choosing normal pouring, quiet pouring or intentional rousing of yeast. Entries will be presented during judging as specified by entering brewer.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Unfiltered German Ales are the color of the underlying German ale style. Appearance may or may not be clear, so may appear slightly hazy to moderately cloudy. Exhibiting a small amount of yeast haze is acceptable. These beers are unfiltered, but may be naturally clear due to settling of yeast during aging. Head retention may not be optimal. Kellerbier Ales are unfiltered Germanstyle Altbier and K&ouml;lsch. Aromas typical of the underlying beer style are present. Yeast aroma is desirable, yet should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Low to moderately low levels of yeast-generated sulfur-containing compounds should be apparent in aroma, and low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally removed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. Hop aroma is sometimes suppressed by the presence of yeast, depending on style. Malt character will vary with style (see individual style descriptions). Hop flavor is sometimes suppressed by the presence of yeast, depending on style. Hop bitterness is sometimes suppressed by the presence of yeast, depending on style. Yeast flavor is desirable, yet should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. Low to moderately low levels of yeast-generated sulfur containing compounds should be apparent in flavor, and low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally removed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. Body is variable with style. These unfiltered German-style ales are packaged and/or served intentionally with low to moderate amounts of yeast. Products may be filtered and again dosed with yeast in the package, manifesting themselves as bottle conditioned beers or unfiltered beer with yeast present. During registration brewers may specify pouring instructions, choosing normal pouring, quiet pouring or intentional rousing of yeast. Entries will be presented during judging as specified by entering brewer.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Baltic Porters are very deep ruby/garnet to black. Distinctive malt aromas of caramelized sugars, licorice, and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars are present. Roasted dark malts sometimes contribute coffee-like roast barley aroma. Low smoky aroma from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, may include very low to low complex alcohol aromas and/or lager fruitiness such as berries, grapes, plums, but not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm fermentation is not appropriate. Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics without dominance. Medium-low to medium-high malt sweetness is present, with distinctive flavors of caramelized sugars, licorice, and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts sometimes contribute coffee-like roast barley flavor, yet not bitter or astringent roast character. Low degree of smoky flavor from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Hop flavor is very low. Hop bitterness is low to medium-low. Baltic Porter is a true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast. Because of its alcoholic strength, may include very low to low complex alcohol flavors and/or lager fruitiness such as berries, grapes, plums, but not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate. Diacetyl and DMS flavors should not be apparent. Body is medium to full.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>K&ouml;lschs are straw to gold. Chill haze should be absent. Good, dense head retention is desirable. Fruity-ester aroma should be minimally perceived, if at all. Light pear-apple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Hop aroma is low. Malt character is a very low to low soft sweetness. Caramel character should not be evident. Hop flavor is low. Hop bitterness is medium. Fruity-ester flavors should be minimally perceived, if at all. Light pear-apple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Body is light to medium-light; it is slightly dry on the palate, yet crisp. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. K&ouml;lsch is fermented at warmer temperatures compared to typical lager temperatures but at lower temperatures than most English and Belgian ales, then aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer). Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>English Summer Ales are pale to light amber colored. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Fruity-ester aromas are acceptable at low to moderate levels. No diacetyl or DMS aromas should be apparent. Hop aroma is low to medium-low. English, American or noble-type hop aroma should not be assertive and always well balanced with malt aroma. Residual malt sweetness is low to medium. Torrefied and/or malted wheat are often used in quantities of 25% or less. Malt flavor may be biscuit-like. Hop flavor is low to medium-low. English, American, or noble-type hop flavor should not be assertive and always well balanced with malt character. Hop bitterness is medium-low to medium. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. The overall impression is refreshing and thirst quenching. Low to moderate fruity-ester flavors are acceptable. No diacetyl or DMS flavors should be apparent. Body is low to medium-low.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>English IPAs are gold to copper colored. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Fruity-ester aromas are moderate to very strong. Hop aroma is medium to high, often flowery. Medium malt flavor is present. Hop flavor is medium to strong (in addition to the hop bitterness). Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. Hop bitterness is medium to high. Fruity-ester flavors are moderate to very strong. Most traditional interpretations are characterized by medium to medium-high alcohol content. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Body is medium. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Scottish Light Ales are golden to light brown. Chill haze is allowable at low temperatures. Malty, caramel-like aroma may be present. Fruity-ester aromas are low if evident. Hop aroma is not perceived. Despite its lightness a low to medium-low degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character will be present. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is low. Yeast characters such as diacetyl and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. Bottled versions may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Body is light. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish Light Ale exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many examples with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels. Ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Leipzig Goses are straw to medium amber. Appearance is cloudy/hazy with yeast character, may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Lemony or other citrus-like aromas are often present. Some versions may have the spicy aroma character of added coriander at low to medium levels. Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is none. Malt sweetness is very low to none at all. It typically contains malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is none. Hop bitterness is none. Lemony or other citrus-like flavors are often present. Some versions may have the spicy flavor character of added coriander on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Traditional examples of Gose are spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose it typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Adambiers are light brown to very dark. Toast and caramel-like malt aroma may be evident. Hop aroma is low. Astringency of highly roasted malt should be absent. Toast and caramel-like malt flavors may be evident. Hop flavor is low. Hop bitterness is low to medium. Adambier may or may not use wheat in its formulation. Traditional and non-hybrid varieties of European hops were traditionally used. A K&ouml;lsch-like ale fermentation is typical. Extensive aging and acidification of this beer can mask malt and hop character to varying degrees. Aging in barrels may contribute some level of Brettanomyces and lactic character. Body is medium to full. The style originated in Dortmund, and is a strong, dark, hoppy sour ale extensively aged in wood barrels. Traditional versions may have a low or medium low degree of smokiness. Smoke character may be absent in contemporary versions.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>German Hefeweizens are straw to amber. Because yeast is present appearance may appropriately be very cloudy. The aroma of a German Hefewiezen is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-like, nutmeglike, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like ester aroma should be present at low to medium-high levels. Hop aroma is none to very low. Malt sweetness is very low to medium-low. Hop flavor is none to very low. Hop bitterness is very low. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. No diacetyl should be perceived. The flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-like, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like ester flavor should be present at low to medium-high levels. Hefeweizen is well attenuated and very highly carbonated. Body is medium to full. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel. During registration brewers may specify pouring instructions, choosing normal pouring, quiet pouring or intentional rousing of yeast. Entries will be presented during judging as specified by entering brewer.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>German Dunkel Weizens are copper-brown to dark brown. If served with yeast appearance may appropriately be very cloudy. The phenolic and estery aromas typical of Weissbiers are more subdued in Dunkel Weissbier. No diacetyl aroma should be perceived. Hop aroma is none. Distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt characterize this beer style. Usually dark barley malts are used in conjunction with dark cara or color malts. Hop flavor is none. Hop bitterness is low. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. The phenolic and estery flavors of Dunkel Weissbier should be evident but subdued. Dunkel Weissbier should be well attenuated and very highly carbonated. No diacetyl should be perceived. Body is medium to full. During registration brewers may specify pouring instructions, choosing normal pouring, quiet pouring or intentional rousing of yeast. Entries will be presented during judging as specified by entering brewer.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Belgian Lambics are gold to medium-amber. Cloudiness is acceptable. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas evolved from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. High to very high fruity-ester aromas are present. Hop aroma is none to very low, and can include cheesy or floral lavender-like character. Hop character is achieved by using stale and aged hops at low rates. Lambics are brewed with unmalted wheat and malted barley. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. Hop flavor is none to very low. Hop bitterness is very low. Lambics are unblended, naturally and spontaneously fermented, with high to very high levels of fruity esters, bacterial and yeast derived sourness, that sometimes but not necessarily includes acetic flavors. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic flavors evolved from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. Carbonation can range from low to high. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Body is very light with dry mouthfeel. Lambics originating in the Brussels area are often simply called lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be called true lambics. These versions are said to be &ldquo;Belgian-Style Lambic&rdquo; and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through addition of sugars or artificial sweeteners.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Belgian Gueuze Lambics are gold to medium-amber. Cloudiness is acceptable, as Gueuze is always refermented in the bottle. Gueuze is characterized by intense fruity-estery, sour, and acidic aromas. Diacetyl aroma should be absent. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas evolved from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. Hop aroma is none to very low. Gueuze is brewed with unmalted wheat, malted barley, and stale, aged hops. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. Hop bitterness is very low. Old lambic is blended with newly fermenting young lambic to create this special style of lambic. These unflavored blended and secondary fermented lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and are characterized by intense fruity-estery, sour, and acidic flavors. Diacetyl should be absent. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic flavors evolved from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Body is very light with dry mouthfeel. Gueuze Lambics whose origin is the Brussels area are often simply called gueuze lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium are said to be &ldquo;Belgian-style gueuze lambic.&rdquo; The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional gueuze lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by sugars or artificial sweeteners.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

Hop bitterness is very low. Fruit lambics are characterized by fruit flavors. Sourness is an important part of the flavor profile, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic flavors evolved from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Body is dry to full. Fruit Lambics whose origin is the Brussels area are often simply called fruit lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium are said to be &ldquo;Belgian-style fruit lambic.&rdquo; The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Belgian Flanders Oud Bruins are copper to very dark. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Some versions may be more highly carbonated and, when bottle conditioned, may appear cloudy when served. Roasted malt aromas including a cocoa-like character are acceptable at low levels. Brettanomyces produced aromas may be completely absent or very low. Fruity-estery aroma which is often cherry-like is apparent. Hop aroma is none. Roasted malt flavors including a cocoa-like character are acceptable at low levels. A very low degree of malt sweetness may be present and in balance with the acidity produced by Lactobacillus activity. Hop flavor is none. Hop bitterness is perceived to be low to medium, though acidity and wood aging (if used) may mask higher bitterness unit levels. Overall balance is characterized by slight to strong lactic sourness, and with &ldquo;Reds&rdquo; sometimes a balanced degree of acetic acid. Brettanomyces produced flavors may be absent or very low. Fruity-estery flavor which is often cherry-like is apparent. Body is described as a refreshing mouthfeel. Oak-like or woody characters may be pleasantly integrated into overall palate. Bottle conditioned versions are often blended old with new before packaging in order to create the
brewer&rsquo;s intended balance of characters.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Robust Porters are very dark to black. Hop aroma is very low to medium. They have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor. Caramel and other malty sweetness is in harmony with a sharp bitterness of black malt without a highly burnt/charcoal flavor. Hop flavor is very low to medium. Hop bitterness is medium to high. Diacetyl is acceptable at very low levels. Fruity esters should be evident, balanced with all other characters. Body is medium to full.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Irish Dry Stouts are black. Head retention and rich character should be part of its visual character. The emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Hop aroma is European type at low levels or not perceived. Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. Initial malt and light caramel flavor profile give way to a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish. Emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt flavors define much of the character. Hop flavor is European type at low levels or not perceived. Hop bitterness is perceived as medium to medium high. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness and roasted barley character. Diacetyl should be very low or not perceived. Slight acidity may be perceived but not necessary. Body is medium-light to medium.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Old Ales are copper-red to very dark. Chill haze is acceptable at cold temperatures. Fruity-ester aroma can contribute to the aroma profile. Hop aroma is very low. They have a malty and sometimes caramel-like sweetness. Hop flavor is none to medium. Hop bitterness is minimal but evident. Fruity-ester flavors can contribute to the character of this ale. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Body is medium to full. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>

<F_S_DESCRIPTION>Strong Ales are amber to dark brown. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Rich, often complex fruity-esters can contribute to the aroma profile. Hop aroma is minimal. They have malty and/or caramel-like sweetness. They may have very low levels of roast malt. Hop flavor is none to medium. Hop bitterness is minimal but evident, and balanced with the malt flavors present. Fruity-ester flavors can contribute to the character of this ale as a rich, often sweet and complex estery character. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable. Body is medium to full.</F_S_DESCRIPTION>
